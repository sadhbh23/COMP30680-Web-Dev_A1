          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            As you have probably gathered from the hompage and hero, my name is
            Sadhbh Redmond. I am an MSc Computer Science (Conversion) student at
            University College Dublin (UCD). I began my studies September of
            this year and will continue until December of next year.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began learning to code with
            <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>, as
            you'll learn more about on the

              >My Journey Into Computer Science section</a
            >
            of this page; consequently, most of my experience currently is in
            front-end web development. Additionally, I worked as a quality
            assurance associate in the digital consulting industry for a year.
            From these experiences, I have learned the following:

        <h4>Studying Neuroscience as an Undergraduate</h4>
        <p>
          How I became an MSc computer science student is slightly
          unconventional, as I don't have a computer science or tech background.
          I completed my undergraduate studies in Neuroscience at Trinity
          College Dublin (TCD). I began my undergraduate degree in Biological,
          Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, studying all 11 natural sciences
          for the first two years before specialising for my final two years and
          thesis. While I thoroughly enjoyed studying neuroscience, I knew I
          didn't want to pursue a career in the field; it wasn't the right fit.
        </p>
        <h4>SheCodes</h4>
        <p>
          After finishing my final exams, I took some time to consider what I
          wanted. By chance, I saw an ad on Instagram for an online service
          called
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>. It is
          an online front-end web development academy that provides workshops
          for women who want to break into tech. What I liked about
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>
          compared to other online institutions providing courses in similar
          topics was that they offered their services at a significantly reduced
          rate, as their primary goal is to help bridge the gender gap in tech.
          Additionally, they significantly contribute to charitable causes that
          benefit women worldwide for example, providing relief to women
          refugees in Afghanistan.

          As I wanted to expand my skill set and improve my employability, I
          completed the first course, which covered the fundamentals of HTML5,
          CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6). Upon receiving my certificate, I realised
          that I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the course: learning about
          coding, putting that knowledge to practice, refactoring my work,
          debugging etc. And so, I made the decision to work through all of the
          remaining courses (you can see my certificates on the
          <a href="gallery.html">Gallery page</a> of this site).
        </p>
        <h4>FindAMasters: How About UCD?</h4>
        <p>
          As I worked through the courses, I gradually had more and more skills
          to put on my CV. Eventually, I completed all of
          <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/workshops" target="_blank"
            >SheCodes Pro!</a
          >
          After some consideration, I decided to enhance my portfolio further. I
          began researching other means of expanding my computer skills. It
          became clear that I could try to learn all of the fundamentals by
          myself in a self-directed learning approach. But as someone who
          thrives in a structured environment, I thought I would be better off
          investigating higher education routes again. I came across the MSc
          Computer Science (Conversion) course using the
          <a href="https://www.findamasters.com/" target="_blank"
            >FindAMasters</a
          >
          website (which I highly recommend for anyone seeking further academic
          studies).
        </p>
        <p>
          I spoke with some friends who either had a background in computer
          science, had attended UCD, or both. I wanted their insight on whether
          or not it would be worth it to apply to the course. They all concluded
          that it was very well structured, the content was thorough, and it
          would benefit me and my career progression immensely. With all that
          advice on board, I worked on my application for 10 days, honing it to
          perfection. A few weeks passed, and eventually, I received a response
          from the university; it was an acceptance letter! And now, several
          months later, I am 5 weeks into the course. For more details on the
          MSc itself, please refer to the
