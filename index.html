      <h3>This Project</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        For this project, I had the choice of 3 different websites I could
        create: a personal website, a website for a piece of media or a website
        for a charity or organisation of your choice. I decided on a personal
        website as I thought it would fit nicely in my portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone with a keen interest in visual design and UX/UI, I aimed to
        make the look and feel of the website modern, streamlined and relatively
        minimalistic. I emphasised the contrast between the dark and light
        colours to create visual interest whilst avoiding using pure white
        (#ffffff) or black (#000000) anywhere to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
        Additionally, I incorporated purples, pinks and gradients to have pops
        of colour that I feel reflect my personality without being too visually
        overwhelming.

            Module: (COMP30680) Web-App Development
          </h3>
          <h4 class="project-assignment">Assignment 1: HTML5 & CSS3</h4>
          <p>
            I created this personal portfolio website for my web application
            development module. Before this module, I had gained experience in
            front-end web development, having completed courses and coded a
            couple of projects already; however, this assignment presented a
            unique challenge as it necessitated using only HTML5 and CSS3, no
            libraries or frameworks. It has been quite some time since I created
            a large project in pure HTML5 and CSS3. I am quite a fan of the
            Bootstrap framework: I often use it in my projects. Nevertheless, I
            was excited to return to basics and build on the fundamentals again.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were quite a few specifications for this project. Most
            importantly, it needed to include 5 pages: a homepage, a gallery
            page (one that displayed images in a structured format) and 3 pages
            of our choice. I chose to include an about page, a page with further
            info on my MSc and a contact page, as you will see when you look
            through the website!
